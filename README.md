☕ Cafe Ordering System – Python Beginner Project 📌
Project Overview

Cafe Ordering System is a simple Python project I built as part of my learning journey to understand the fundamentals of Python programming.

This project simulates a small cafe ordering system, allowing users to:

View a menu of drinks or snacks.

Place orders for multiple items.

Keep track of the running total.

See the final bill.

The goal of this project is learning and practice, not complexity. While the project is basic, it demonstrates my understanding of beginner Python concepts and how to apply them in a small, working program.

🧠 What I Learned from This Project

Through this project, I practiced and applied:

Variables and arithmetic operations

Lists, loops, and conditional statements

Functions and function calls

User input handling and validation

Reading CSV files using pandas

Writing clean, readable, and well-structured code

⚙️ How the Program Works

The user is greeted with a welcome message.

The user chooses whether they want drinks or snacks.

The menu is displayed with item numbers and prices.

The user selects the items and quantities they want to order.

The program calculates the running total as orders are added.

The user can continue ordering multiple items until they choose to stop.

The final total bill is displayed.

This project helped me practice breaking a problem into smaller functions and managing program flow logically.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas (for reading CSV files)

Concepts: Functions, loops, conditionals, user input, file handling

🚀 How to Run the Project

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Install pandas if not already installed:

pip install pandas


Clone or download this repository.

Make sure drinks.csv and snacks.csv are in the same folder as the script.

Open a terminal in the project folder.

Run the program:

python main.py


Follow the prompts to place your order and see your final bill.

🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project is meant to:

Showcase my Python skills as a beginner.

Demonstrate my ability to write functional and readable Python code.

Show my willingness to learn by building hands-on projects.

I am actively learning Python and plan to improve this project with features like:

Itemized receipt generation

Removing or editing orders

More categories like desserts and combos
